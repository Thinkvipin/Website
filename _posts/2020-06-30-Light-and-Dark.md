The best thing about light is/
It brightens up the darkest spaces/
The worst thing about light is/
It reanimates buried faces

I think many people will agree that/
Light symbolises hope, goodness and a new day/
It gives you a life, and a purpose to live/
Or so they say

You see, sometimes darkness isn't all that bad/
Neither is light as good/
Some days I want the darkness to blind me/
So I can't see where the headstones stood

Light doesn't just brighten something up/
It shows you the whole road/
With your past and you future, and a fork in the end/
And it forces you to carry all that load

It's at times like this/
That I crave for darkness/
For it to come and handicap me/
Because I can't see then/
But neither can my demons/
And in those moments I'm completely free

Light makes me see the good in people/
The good in people/
That apparently everyone has since birth/
But it's the dark that lets me run away/
From the graves and abandoned faces/
To a place of solace, to a place of rebirth.
