There's a portrait in my attic\
It's a window to my soul\
There's a portrait in my attic\
But it's not me anymore

I smile wide in real life\
But in the portrait I'm all frowns\
I feel so alone, can't reach out for help\
I stand there helplessly as the real me drowns

I stand in front of a mirror\
To confront my demon and end the pain\
But i only see my reflection looking back at me\
Taunting me to take the step, to do something inhumane

I fight the demon as I fight myself\
I fight him because I want to live more\
But I feel losing and giving in\
And finally, I stop resisting, as I sink into the floor

And then i stand up\
Tying a noose around my neck as the portrait starts burning up\
I silently apologize to everyone I know\
As I see the golden light, the roar in my ears turning up

Now, as the picture crumbles to ashes\
I puff out my last breath\
And in my most final moments I know\
There's nothing as peaceful, yet just as selfish\
As being a murderer, delivering your own death.
